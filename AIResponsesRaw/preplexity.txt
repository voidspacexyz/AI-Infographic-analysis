To solve this logical puzzle, we need to analyze the statements step by step.

### Analyzing the Statements

1. **Statement (a)**: This sentence (a) is true, as is (b), but exactly one of (c) and (d) is true.
   - This means that both statements (a) and (b) are true.
   - Only one of statements (c) or (d) can be true.

2. **Statement (b)**: There is a king in the hand, or there is a queen in the hand.
   - Since (b) is true, at least one of the following must hold:
     - There is a king in the hand.
     - There is a queen in the hand.

3. **Statement (c)**: If there is a queen in the hand, then there is an ace in the hand.
4. **Statement (d)**: If there is a king in the hand, then there is an ace in the hand.

### Evaluating Possibilities

Since statement (a) states that both (a) and (b) are true, we can conclude:
- **(b)** is true: There is either a king or a queen in the hand.

Now, since exactly one of (c) or (d) must be true, we will evaluate both scenarios:

#### Case 1: Assume (c) is true
- If there is a queen in the hand, then there must be an ace in the hand.
- If there’s no queen, then statement (c) does not provide any information about the existence of an ace.
- Statement (d) would then be false, meaning if there is a king, there cannot be an ace.

In this case:
- If there's a queen → There’s an ace.
- If there's a king → No ace.

This leads to two possibilities:
- Queen present → Ace present.
- King present → Ace absent.

#### Case 2: Assume (d) is true
- If there is a king in the hand, then there must be an ace in the hand.
- If there’s no king, then statement (d) does not provide any information about the existence of an ace.
- Statement (c) would then be false, meaning if there is a queen, there cannot be an ace.

In this case:
- If there's a queen → No ace.
- If there's a king → Ace present.

This leads to two possibilities:
- Queen present → Ace absent.
- King present → Ace present.

### Conclusion

From our analysis:

1. **If statement (c) is true**: We can have either a queen with an ace or a king without an ace.
2. **If statement (d) is true**: We can have either a king with an ace or a queen without an ace.

Since exactly one of statements (c) and (d) can be true, we see that it creates scenarios where sometimes we have an ace and sometimes we do not.

Thus, we conclude that:

### Final Answer
**3. There may or may not be an ace in the hand.**

This reflects the ambiguity introduced by having only one of statements (c) or (d) being true while still satisfying statement (b).
