### Understanding the Problem

We are given a deck of cards and four statements labeled (a) through (d). Our goal is to determine the truth about the ace in the hand based on these statements. The options provided are:

1. There is an ace in the hand.
2. There is not an ace in the hand.
3. There may or may not be an ace in the hand.
4. There is a contradiction: there is both an ace and no ace.

Let's break down each statement and analyze their implications.

### Analyzing Statement (a)

**Statement (a):** "This sentence (a) is true, as is (b), but exactly one of (c) and (d) is true."

This is a self-referential statement. It claims that:

- (a) is true.
- (b) is true.
- Exactly one of (c) or (d) is true.

Given that (a) is true, we can accept that (b) is also true, and exactly one of (c) or (d) is true.

### Analyzing Statement (b)

**Statement (b):** "There is a king in the hand, or there is a queen in the hand."

Since (b) is true (from statement (a)), we know that at least one of the following is true:

- There is a king in the hand.
- There is a queen in the hand.

This means the hand contains at least one king or one queen.

### Analyzing Statements (c) and (d)

**Statement (c):** "If there is a queen in the hand, then there is an ace in the hand."

**Statement (d):** "If there is a king in the hand, then there is an ace in the hand."

From statement (a), we know that exactly one of (c) or (d) is true. Therefore, we need to consider two scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1:** (c) is true, and (d) is false.
2. **Scenario 2:** (d) is true, and (c) is false.

Let's explore each scenario.

#### Scenario 1: (c) is true, and (d) is false.

- **Statement (c) is true:** If there is a queen in the hand, then there is an ace in the hand.

  - This means that the presence of a queen guarantees the presence of an ace.

- **Statement (d) is false:** The implication "If there is a king in the hand, then there is an ace in the hand" is not true.

  - For an implication to be false, the antecedent (there is a king) must be true, and the consequent (there is an ace) must be false.

  - Therefore, in this scenario:
    - There is a king in the hand.
    - There is no ace in the hand.

Now, recall from statement (b) that there is either a king or a queen in the hand.

- Since we've established that there is a king in the hand (from (d) being false), and there is no ace in the hand, we need to check if this aligns with statement (c).

- Statement (c) says that if there is a queen, then there is an ace. However, in this scenario, there is no ace, which implies there cannot be a queen (because if there were a queen, there would have to be an ace).

- Therefore, in this scenario:
  - There is a king in the hand.
  - There is no queen in the hand.
  - There is no ace in the hand.

This scenario is consistent with all statements:
- (a) is true.
- (b) is true (there is a king).
- (c) is true (since there is no queen, the implication holds vacuously).
- (d) is false (there is a king but no ace).

#### Scenario 2: (d) is true, and (c) is false.

- **Statement (d) is true:** If there is a king in the hand, then there is an ace in the hand.

  - This means that the presence of a king guarantees the presence of an ace.

- **Statement (c) is false:** The implication "If there is a queen in the hand, then there is an ace in the hand" is not true.

  - For an implication to be false, the antecedent (there is a queen) must be true, and the consequent (there is an ace) must be false.

  - Therefore, in this scenario:
    - There is a queen in the hand.
    - There is no ace in the hand.

Now, recall from statement (b) that there is either a king or a queen in the hand.

- Since we've established that there is a queen in the hand (from (c) being false), and there is no ace in the hand, we need to check if this aligns with statement (d).

- Statement (d) says that if there is a king, then there is an ace. However, in this scenario, there is no ace, which implies there cannot be a king (because if there were a king, there would have to be an ace).

- Therefore, in this scenario:
  - There is a queen in the hand.
  - There is no king in the hand.
  - There is no ace in the hand.

This scenario is also consistent with all statements:
- (a) is true.
- (b) is true (there is a queen).
- (c) is false (there is a queen but no ace).
- (d) is true (since there is no king, the implication holds vacuously).

### Comparing Both Scenarios

In both scenarios, we've deduced that there is no ace in the hand:

- **Scenario 1:** No ace, but there is a king.
- **Scenario 2:** No ace, but there is a queen.

However, we need to ensure that both scenarios are possible given the constraints.

Let's revisit statement (a): "This sentence (a) is true, as is (b), but exactly one of (c) and (d) is true."

In both scenarios, exactly one of (c) or (d) is true, and (b) is true, which aligns with statement (a).

### Conclusion

Based on the logical analysis of both scenarios, we consistently find that there is no ace in the hand. Therefore, the correct statement about the ace is:

**2. There is not an ace in the hand.**
