Let's analyze the statements one by one and determine the truth values of each statement.

1. **Statement (a):** "This sentence (a) is true, as is (b), but exactly one of (c) and (d) is true."
   - This means that (a) and (b) are true, and exactly one of (c) and (d) is true.

2. **Statement (b):** "There is a king in the hand, or there is a queen in the hand."
   - Since (a) states that (b) is true, (b) must be true. Therefore, there is either a king or a queen in the hand (or both).

3. **Statement (c):** "If there is a queen in the hand, then there is an ace in the hand."
   - We don't know yet whether this is true or false.

4. **Statement (d):** "If there is a king in the hand, then there is an ace in the hand."
   - We don't know yet whether this is true or false.

Given that (a) is true, we know that (b) is true and exactly one of (c) and (d) is true.

### Case Analysis:

**Case 1: There is a king in the hand.**
- If there is a king, then (b) is true because there is a king.
- If (d) is true (since exactly one of (c) and (d) must be true), then there must be an ace in the hand.
- If (c) is false, then the presence of a queen does not imply the presence of an ace.

**Case 2: There is a queen in the hand.**
- If there is a queen, then (b) is true because there is a queen.
- If (c) is true (since exactly one of (c) and (d) must be true), then there must be an ace in the hand.
- If (d) is false, then the presence of a king does not imply the presence of an ace.

**Case 3: There are both a king and a queen in the hand.**
- If there are both a king and a queen, then (b) is true because there is both a king and a queen.
- If (c) is true, then there must be an ace in the hand.
- If (d) is true, then there must be an ace in the hand.
- However, this contradicts the condition that exactly one of (c) and (d) is true. Therefore, this case is not possible.

**Case 4: There is neither a king nor a queen in the hand.**
- If there is neither a king nor a queen, then (b) is false, which contradicts the condition that (b) is true. Therefore, this case is not possible.

From the analysis, we see that in both valid cases (Case 1 and Case 2), there must be an ace in the hand. Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. There is an ace in the hand.
