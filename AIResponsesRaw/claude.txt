Let me solve this step by step by analyzing the statements and their logical implications.

Let me first write out the statements formally:
- (a) says: "This statement (a) is true, (b) is true, and exactly one of (c) or (d) is true"
- (b) says: "There is a king OR there is a queen"
- (c) says: "If queen then ace"
- (d) says: "If king then ace"

1) From (a), we know that (b) is true and exactly one of (c) or (d) is false

2) From (b) being true, we know there must be either a king or queen (or both) in the hand

3) Let's consider all possibilities:
   - If there's only a king:
     - (b) is satisfied
     - If (c) is true, it doesn't matter (no queen)
     - If (d) is true, there must be an ace
   - If there's only a queen:
     - (b) is satisfied
     - If (c) is true, there must be an ace
     - If (d) is true, it doesn't matter (no king)
   - If there's both king and queen:
     - (b) is satisfied
     - If (c) is true, there must be an ace
     - If (d) is true, there must be an ace

4) Since exactly one of (c) or (d) must be false (from statement a):
   - If there's a king and (d) is false: there cannot be an ace
   - If there's a queen and (c) is false: there cannot be an ace

5) Given that (b) is true (there must be a king or queen), and exactly one of (c) or (d) must be false, we can conclude that the hand cannot contain an ace. If it did contain an ace, both (c) and (d) would be true, which contradicts statement (a).

Therefore, option 2 is correct: There is not an ace in the hand.

This is because:
- We must have either a king or queen (or both) from (b)
- One of the implications (c) or (d) must be false from (a)
- For whichever card we have (king or queen), its corresponding implication must be false (otherwise both implications would be true)
- Therefore, there cannot be an ace in the hand
