Let's analyze each statement carefully to figure out the truth about the ace.

---

### **Step 1: Analyze (a) — the meta-statement**
- **(a)** says: "This sentence (a) is true, as is (b), but **exactly one** of (c) and (d) is true."
  So, if (a) is true, then:
  1. (b) is true.
  2. Exactly one of (c) and (d) is true.

If (a) were false, the entire logical structure collapses. So let's **assume (a) is true** and check for consistency.

---

### **Step 2: From (a), (b) is true**
- **(b)**: "There is a king in the hand, **or** there is a queen in the hand."
  Since (b) is true, **at least one** of these is in the hand.

We now have two cases:
1. **There is a king** (whether or not there's a queen).
2. **There is a queen but no king**.

We’ll explore both and see which fits.

---

### **Step 3: Test the possibilities for (c) and (d)**

#### **Case 1: Assume there is a king in the hand**
- If there's a king, then look at **(d)**: "If there is a king, then there is an ace."
  - Since the king is present, for (d) to be **true**, there must be an ace.
  - For (d) to be **false**, there must be **no ace**.

But (a) says **only one** of (c) or (d) is true.

Let’s test both options:
- **If (d) is true** → there’s an ace. Then (c) could also be true if there’s a queen and an ace — but that would make both (c) and (d) true, violating the "exactly one" condition in (a).
- **So, (d) must be false** → meaning, there’s a king but **no ace**.

Now, (c) must be true (since only one can be true and (d) is false).

- **(c)**: "If there is a queen, then there is an ace."
  - Since we've already decided there’s **no ace**, for (c) to be true, the condition must be vacuously true — meaning, there is **no queen**.

**Result of Case 1:**
- King ✅
- Queen ❌
- Ace ❌

This fits all conditions:
- (b) is true (because of the king).
- (c) is true (vacuously, since no queen).
- (d) is false (king is there but no ace).
- (a) holds: (b) is true, and exactly one of (c)/(d) is true.

---

#### **Case 2: Assume there is no king, but there is a queen**
- (b) would still be true (queen is present).
- (c): "If there is a queen, then there is an ace."
  - Queen is present, so for (c) to be true, there must be an ace.
- If (c) is true, (d) would be vacuously true (since there is no king), but then **both** (c) and (d) would be true — again violating (a).

So this case fails.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**
The only consistent scenario is **Case 1**, where there is:
- **A king**,
- **No queen**, and
- **No ace**.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

### **2. There is not an ace in the hand.**
